<LI>To compile the code, you will need to download two (header-only) repos:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="https://github.com/mkazhdan/Misha">Misha</A> library.
<LI><A HREF="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">Eigen</A> library.
</UL>
For both you will need to modify the definition of the include directories in the Makefile/solution-file to point to the locations of the repos on your hard-dirve.

<LI>Test data can be found in the <code>Data</code> sub-folder

</UL>
